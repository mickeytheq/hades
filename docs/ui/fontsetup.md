# Font setup

Hades requires that the following font files are installed by the user

- Arno Pro regular
- Arno Pro bold
- Arno Pro italic
- Arno Pro bold-italic

These fonts are free to use by end-users for non-commercial purposes. However the license does not permit them to be bundled with software so they must be installed manually.

The first time you launch Hades you may have to take the following steps

1. A progress dialog will be shown trying to and failing to find the required font files. This is totally normal the first time after you install Hades
2. Close this dialog
3. A new screen will appear that shows the status of the font files. Each font has a button next to it to open the desired install location on your computer and to launch a web browser to download the font
4. Click the `Download location` button next to the first missing font file. This should open a browser window to the download page. Download it
5. Return to the Hades setup screen click the `Expected location` button. This should open a local file explorer to the install location (this is the Strange Eons plug-in folder)
6. Copy the downloaded font file into the install location. Do not change the name
7. In the Hades setup screen click the `Refresh` button at the bottom. A progress dialog should show it looking for the fonts again. You should see first font has been successfully located. Clicking close and the status of the installed font should now say `Installed`
8. Repeat for all the remaining missing font files. You can download/copy them all in together and just do `Refresh` once if you prefer
9. Once all the font files are installed hit `Continue` and Strange Eons should finish launching

## Troubleshooting

If the download page won't open when you press the button the direct font links are:

- Arno Pro regular - [here](https://www.dafontfree.net/arno-pro-regular-font/f64439.htm)
- Arno Pro bold - [here](https://www.dafontfree.net/arno-pro-bold-font/f64426.htm)
- Arno Pro italic - [here](https://www.dafontfree.net/arno-pro-italic-font/f64432.htm)
- Arno Pro bold-italic - [here](https://www.dafontfree.net/arno-pro-bold-italic-font/f64427.htm)

If Hades is not detecting the font files after downloading and copying them check the following by

- You have copied the font files to the right directory
- The filenames are the correct case (see the font setup screen)
