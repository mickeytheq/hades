# Migration from the AHLCG plugin

If you have existing content created in Strange Eons you can migrate it into Hades by doing the following

1. Open the existing project in Strange Eons
2. R-click select `Hades -> Migrate AHLCG plugin content to Hades`
3. Select a target directory to create the new Hades content in. Hades will not let you select the directory of the current project as that would result in all your content being overwritten
4. It is recommended to choose a directory on the same level as your current project. For example if you current project is `C:\files\Arkham\MickeyTheQ-Investigators\` then create/select a new folder like `C:\files\Arkham\MickeyTheQ-Investigators-Hades\`
5. Click OK
6. A progress dialog will appear that shows Hades performing the migration. If you see any errors or warnings then please review them and [report](../feedback.md) them
7. Close the progress dialog
8. In Strange Eons do `File -> Open Project` and navigate to the new Hades project location specified above
9. Review the content and please [report](../feedback.md) any issues
